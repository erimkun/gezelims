# Vercel Web Analytics Implementation Report

## Summary
Successfully implemented Vercel Web Analytics for the Istanbul's Pearl (Üsküdar) React application.

## Changes Made

### 1. Installed Dependencies
- Added `@vercel/analytics` package to the project
- Package installed via npm, with all dependencies resolved successfully

### 2. Modified Files

#### src/App.tsx
- **Import Added**: Imported the `Analytics` component from `@vercel/analytics/react`
- **Component Integration**: Added the `<Analytics />` component at the end of the main container div, inside the `ToastProvider` and `ErrorBoundary` wrappers
- **Placement**: The Analytics component is positioned to track all page views across the application, including:
  - Main map view
  - Mini-games page  
  - Routes page

### 3. Implementation Details

The Analytics component was added following React best practices for the framework:
- Placed inside the main app container to ensure it tracks all user interactions
- Positioned after all other content but within the main rendering tree
- Works seamlessly with the existing lazy-loaded components (Map, Sidebar, MiniGames, RoutesPage)

The integration follows the official Vercel documentation for React applications using the `@vercel/analytics/react` package.
